Singleton Design Pattern:

The Singleton design pattern ensures that a class has only one instance and provides a global point of access to that instance.

Why Use Singleton:

Single Instance: Ensure there's only one instance of a class.

Global Access: Provides a central point to access that instance throughout the application.

Simple Explanation:

Imagine you have a special house key. The Singleton pattern is like ensuring that there's only one key for that particular house, and everyone in the neighborhood uses that same key to access the house. It's a way to make sure there's a single, easily shared access point to something important in your program, like a unique resource or manager.
